## About Me

I'm a freshman at Columbia University, and I'm excited to learn more about computer science and machine learning. I'm particularly interested in natural language processing and computer vision, and I hope to use machine learning to solve real-world problems in the future.

Thanks for taking the time to read this README file! If you have any questions or comments, feel free to reach out to me.
